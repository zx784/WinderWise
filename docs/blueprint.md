## Core Features:

- Intelligent City Suggestion: If the destination city is unspecified, leverage a generative AI tool to intelligently suggest a city based on all other user inputs, providing a data-driven justification for the suggestion.
- AI Itinerary Generation: Generate a personalized, day-by-day itinerary based on user preferences (interests, budget, duration, travel style). Each day includes suggested timings, activity descriptions, and alternatives, crafted using generative AI to produce coherent and engaging content.
- Transparent Cost Breakdown: Provide a detailed cost breakdown (accommodation, food, transport, activities) tailored to the selected budget tier, displaying it in a visually appealing manner.
- Curated Place Recommendations: Display a curated list of key places to visit, categorized by user interests, with concise and engaging descriptions, dynamically incorporating recognized places from uploaded images.
- Image-Driven Recommendations: Enable users to upload images of places. Use the AI to perform place recognition, identifying landmarks/locations and providing travel suggestions in their vicinity.  These can seed/refine the travel suggestions in their vicinity.
